\cvsect{Personal Statement}

My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it. I plan to bring that goal into reality by creating technology that improves the quality of life. These goals have motivated my passion for software engineering and the open-source community as a tool for sharing knowledge. This objective has led me to a voluntary internship at NIWA, collaborating with scientists and physicists to publish their research on our oceans and atmosphere to a global audience. Software is a medium to explore my scientific curiosity and contribute a meaningful change.

%   ProjectsThe Wellington Hub was hosted by Niwa.

% TODO [x] expand on project descriptions

\cvsect{Projects}

\textbf{\href{https://github.com/woodRock/verbose-computing-machine}{Advent of Code}} \\
An advent calendar of programming puzzles that are language agnostic. The functional programming language Haskell was chosen. In Haskell, programs cannot store state so functions cannot have unintended side effects. Reducing the likelihood of errors meant solving problems faster. Incorrect submissions were penalized, so test cases were verified before submitting a final answer. \\

\textbf{\href{https://github.com/woodRock/psychic-invention}{Data Ingestion}} \\
Ingesting Benthic Biodiversity data into the \href{https://nzodn.nz/}{NZODN portal}. This is an open-source technology stack that implements OGC standards. It uses tools such as GeoServer to providing web services to display maps, and GeoNetwork as a CMS for a metadata catalogue. We configure the software to use a Postgres database storing geospatial data. \\

\textbf{Mission Control System} \\
Runs on a laptop in the field to display telemetry data from a rocket. It presents Monte Carlo simulation data to predict possible landing locations. It was developed as a group using agile and scrum methodologies. We strived for the software quality attribute of portability. To do this we implemented an open-source web map service that can display locally stored map data for offline usage.

%   Technical Skills
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% TODO [x] mention areas of knowledge - Python, JavaScript, R, Git, LaTeX, Postgres
% TODO [x] avoid abstract measurements of capability. I am a student I don't have much experience in anything

\cvsect{Technical Tools}

\textbf{Scripting:} General knowledge of the fundamental principles and tradeoffs for a breadth and depth of programming languages. Consisting of both the Functional and Object Oriented paradigms, and a mix of High and Low-level languages. \textbf{JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React, Angular, Vue, Java, Ruby, Haskell, Common-Lisp, C, C++} \\

\textbf{Machine Learning:} Practical experience implementing machine learning pipelines to produce business knowledge from real-world datasets. Use of scripting languages for preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, training and testing, and data visualization. \textbf{Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Weka} \\

\textbf{Databases:} Academic and practical knowledge in both SQL and NoSQL database systems. Created databases using cloud services that are utilized in full-stack applications. \textbf{Firebase, Postgres, Postgis, SQLite, MongoDB} \\

\textbf{Workflow:} Git is an amazing tool for version control and agile documentation of development. It provides an excellent environment for a development community, working together asynchronously and remotely. \textbf{Git, Gitlab, Github, GitBucket, Jira, LaTeX, Markdown, PlantUML}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%   Workshops
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% TODO [x] mention workshops  attended - Foss4G, Python Data Ingestion, Databases 101

\cvsect{Workshops}

\textbf{FOSS4G SoTM} \\
Due to the virus, local hubs for the international event were held. This conference covers cutting edge open-source GIS software. A former developer at MapBox found out their software was being used for drone strikes in the middle east. An important takeaway from the conference was the ethics of the software we develop. \\

\textbf{Python Data Ingestion} \\
The attendees were mostly data scientists and software developers. This covered using Python for Scientific Computing. We explored the Anaconda environment for Python development for package management. It can be used to replicate a python environment on another machine. A Jupyter notebook is an important tool for Literate Programming as it merges documentation and codebases. \\

\textbf{Databases 101} \\
There was an interesting discussion that compared RDBMS vs NoSQL databases. There is are certain tradeoffs between different software quality attributes, and risks involve getting vendor locked into proprietary cloud software (i.e., AWS, Azure or Firebase). As a developer who creates and maintains these databases, it was useful to understand the goals of the end-users of the product.
