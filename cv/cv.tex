%	INTRODUCTION, SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% My opening paragraph would look great on any other CV.
% Because I am discussing abstract ideas, rather than framing what I have done.

% TODO [ ] Talk about what I have done specifically
% TODO [ ] Don't frame me as a student
% TODO [ ] Should highlight that there is gold here
% TODO [ ] Specify which field, and areas of software engineering I am passionate about
% TODO [ ] Work at Niwa is gold as are my hobbies in AI and Robotics

\cvsect{Personal Statement}

My goal is to leave the world a better place than I found it. I plan to bring that goal into reality by creating technology which improves the quality of life. These goals have motivated my passion for software engineering and the open-source community as a tool for sharing knowledge. This objective has led me to a voluntary internship at NIWA, collaborating with scientists and physicists in their research on our oceans and atmosphere to the world. Software is a medium to explore my scientific curiosity and contribute a meaningful change.

		{2020 -- Now\\\footnotesize{part time}}
		{Software Developer Internship}
		{Niwa}
		{
			My work was a multi-disciplinary collaboration to implement an end to end best practice OGC Standard software. We utilized an open-source technology stack to create web services that queried a database on a Linux cloud server. Data understanding was an important area of this work. Without previous expertise in Geo-Physics or Biology, I learned to extract requirements for software from across disciplines. I documented and presented my work to non-technical users through best practise agile methodology.
			\\\\
			The SARS-2 COVID-19 pandemic obstructed my ability to work onsite. During this time I learnt how to work remotely from home, utilizing industry-standard tools like Microsoft Teams for communication and Pulse Secure for offsite encrypted access to the NIWA intranet. I had to adapt to the new environment of working from home and remain productive.

		{
			In this role, I learnt to organise a team to work efficiently. As Maitre D', I developed a holistic approach to ensuring that the needs of every customer were met. Equal attention had to be provided to maintain an excellent quality of service. Here I learnt how to compensate diners who experienced mistakes or unsatisfactory wait times. This role helped me understand how to deliver value to a customer and to be honest regarding roadblocks.

		{Bartender, Barista, Kitchenhand}
		{Mac's Brewery}
		{
			This was my first job. I upskilled over time to learn all aspects of the trade. Building strong soft skills in communication, event management, and conflict resolution. This was a fast-paced environment that involved risk management, which often led to negotiations with disorderly customers. I learnt to work under pressure and remain calm in combative situations.
