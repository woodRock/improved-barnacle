\section*{Projects}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Map Service & \textbf{GIS, Shapefile, Postgis, Mapserver, Leaflet}
\\
& This project is an implementation of a web application that uses a web map service (WMS). The WMS provides a service to query a Postgis (psql extension) database. Currently it uses Apache2 to provide the service over the localhost.
\\
Portfolio & \textbf{React, Firebase, Markdown}
\\
& The content for each of the static pages is written in markdown. Then the react-markdown package converts it into html. The dynamically generated content is retrieved from a Firebase database. The authentication for the website is provided through Firebase as well.
\\
SCARA & \textbf{Direct/Inverse Kinematics, Java, SVG Parser}
\\
& The Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) was a drawing tool that could be programmed to draw an SVG image. The machine consisted of two articulated joints, connected to a pen. Direct and inverse kinematics are used to calculate the voltage required to move the arms into the desired position. The firmware for the arm was written using Java. Additionally, there was a simulation of the arm, such that the functionality could be tested remotely.
\\
IZack & \textbf{Java, MVC, API, VCS}
\\
& This was a subaquatic rouge-like dungeon crawler. It started as a clone of the Binding of Izaac. It was written using Java swing UI. The program consisted of libarires which were used in together to form an MVC model. It was a group project, that relied on the Gitlab's VCS.
\\
AVC & \textbf{C++, SHH, RasPi, PID, AV}
\\
& The Autonomous Vehicle challenge. This involved creating a self-driving vehicle to complete a variety of tasks. The vehicle was controlled using a microcontroller with firmware written in C++. The tasks included; opening a gate via SSH, staying in the middle of a path and navigating a maze.
